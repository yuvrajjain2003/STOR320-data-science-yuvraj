## Chapter 2

#### Calling Functions

If you make an assignment, you don't get to see the value. You're then tempted to immediately double-check the result. This comon action can be shortened by surrounding the assignment with parentheses, which causes assignment and "print to screen" to happen.

```{r}
(this_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5)
```

### Exercises (Pg 40)

1. Why does this code not work?

It's because there is typo in `my_variable` where the i has been replace with some weird character that does not have a dot on its i. 

2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl = 8).   # Error in the spelling of 'filter'
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```
